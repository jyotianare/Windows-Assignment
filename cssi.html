        <strong> EXTERNAL CSS:</strong> <br>
        CSS is kept separately inside a .css stylesheet. <br>

        <strong> Hexadecimal Colors</strong> <br>
        A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal
        integers specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF.
        For example, the #0000ff value is rendered as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (ff)
        and the others are set to 00.
    </div>

    <div class="container">

        <br>
        <strong> RGB Colors</strong> <br>
        An RGB color value is specified with the rgb() function, which has the following syntax:
        <br>
        rgb(red, green, blue)
        <br>
        Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color and can be an integer between 0 and 255
        or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%). <br>
        For example, the rgb(0,0,255) value is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value
        (255) and the others are set to 0.

        </strong> <br> HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate
        representation of colors.
        <br>
        An HSL color value is specified with the hsl() function, which has the following syntax:
        <br>
        hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        <br>
        Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) - 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue. Saturation is
        a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is
        black, 100% is white.
